# Neural-Networks
Some code used to train neural network models during my PhD.

Please see example.yaml for a list of supported options and arguments.

### main.py:

Based on the input arguments provided in the yaml file, main.py will instantiate the appropriate a trainer and model classes and train the neural network model according to these specifications. 

If multiple values are provided for a single argument this script will take the cartesian product of all 
arguments and train a single network for each unique permutation.

## Trainers.py:

**Trainer** Implements data loading, forward pass, backpropagation and plotting

Inherited by:

**ObservationTrainer** - Train basic vision models.

**Saccadetrainer** - Train 'saccading' vision models.

**Transitiontrainer** - Train dynamic models of time series / videos.

**PrednetTrainer** - Train Prednet (encode prediction errors).

**InteractiveTrainer** - Interact with Unity during trainer.

Each trainer optimises a single 'model'.

## Models.py:

Implements the data flow in the forward pass of a model. 

**ObservationVAE** - Simple VAE.

**VRNN** - Variational recurrent neural network (simple world model).

**HVRNN** - Hierarchical variational recurrent neural network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12165.pdf).

**PrednetWorldModel** - based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122 and https://coxlab.github.io/prednet/.

Each model consists of one or more 'modules'.

## Modules.py:

Defines requires tensor operations. 

Provides encoding and decoding networks for the MNIST, Celeba, animalai, stl-10, dSprites, atari.
Includes conv, FC and resnet versions of most of these.
